In this assessment, we have the follow problem: Soccer passing strategies. First, you will make the effectiveness of this approach depends on technical skill, tactical understanding, and coordination between players. Let's get started!\n",

    "Soccer passing strategies, especially those that move the ball from goalkeeper to striker quickly and efficiently without a long shot or <i>hot link</i>, are critical in the modern game. The idea is to maintain possession of the ball, moving it across the pitch with a series of short, controlled passes, often involving midfielders and defenders. From the following graph, find the most efficient passing path leaving the goalkeeper (1) and arriving at the last attacker (11), considering the possible connections and distances between players on the same team.\n",
